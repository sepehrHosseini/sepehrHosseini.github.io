In my opinion, it goes Apple > Microsoft > Google > Samsung.\n\n# Getting started\n\nSo, first off lets go to this [GitHub repo.](https://github.com/samuelngs/apple-emoji-linux)\n\nAs said in the readme, let's head over to [releases](https://github.com/samuelngs/apple-emoji-linux/releases).\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69592270/106525498-112c3c00-64b2-11eb-9e2e-ee407d87a06c.png)\n\nClick to install the AppleColorEmoji.ttf file.\n\nWhen it's installed, you'll have to copy it over and replace it with your previous emoji file.\n\n```bash\n# ~\ncd /usr/share/fonts/truetype/noto\n\n# /usr/share/fonts/truetype/noto\n$ ls -a\nNotoColorEmoji.ttf  NotoMono-Regular.ttf  .uuid\n```\n\nNow, let's uninstall our NotoColorEmoji.ttf file.\n\n```bash\n# usr/share/fonts/truetype/noto\n$ sudo rm NotoColorEmoji.ttf\n```\n\nNow, we need to copy over our fonts from our directory we installed them from to this\n\n```bash\n# usr/share/fonts/truetype/noto\n$ sudo cp ~/path-to/AppleColorEmoji.ttf .\n```\n\nNow, let's logout of our system.\n\nLog back in, head over to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.com/) and you should see Apple emojis on your Linux system!\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69592270/106526704-14282c00-64b4-11eb-9f60-36bb704b2fac.png)\n\nThat's it for today. If this was able to help you, I'm glad.\n","title":"Using Apple Emojis in Linux","date":"2021-05-13","formattedDate":"13 May, 2021","description":"Hello everyone!
