When in India, I saw that there was a new trend of ordering food online, namely from [Zomato](https://zomato.com/) & [Swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com/). During my time in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), I used both of these apps regularly, as I found them convenient. A few weeks prior to this, I also redesigned the [Nike mobile app](https://www.behance.net/gallery/127241567/Nike-Mobile). With some extra time on my hands, I decided to take up another redesign project.\n\n# Planning\n\nTo start, I had downloaded both the [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com/mobile) & [Swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com/app) mobile app on my iPhone. Out of these two, I decided that I'd like to redesign the [Swiggy App](https://www.swiggy.com/app), as I felt personally that I had a better experience with it. \n\nFirst, I decided to look at the different issues with usability the app had. Some of the main issues which I noticed is that there are no dish ratings on the food, along with the iconography being mixed in weirdly with the application. \n\nNext, I decided to the do other most logical thing. Compare [Swiggy](https://swiggy.com) to it's main competitor on the market, [Zomato](https://zomato.com). One thing I hate about [Zomato](https://zomato.com) is the cluttering everywhere. There's just so much information & bloat with a congested layout, giving the design a [claustrophobic](https://barker-christol.com/design-for-the-claustrophobic) feel. However, I read a survey [comparing Swiggy and Zomato](https://www.g2.com/compare/swiggy-vs-zomato), where [Zomato](https://zomato.com) was dominating most categories. This is because although their UI might be more cluttered, [Zomato](https://zomato.com) provides more utility within the app, which is a huge upside for customers. \n\n# User Interface\n\n[Swiggy](https://swiggy.com) is an application mainly used by students, & lazy cooks. The main age group ranges from 18-30, as older people generally tend to cook their food at home. Henceforth, I decided to go with modern & dark colours, going with the [Dark Design](https://creativemarket.com/blog/design-trend-report-dark-theme) trend of 2021. The colour scheme I used within the app was monochromatic, and consisted of only shades & tones of white. To highlight the different screens, I used a modern & sleek shade of green, making the screens pop-out even more.\n\nGoing with the minimalistic look, I decided to use [Iconly](https://www.brandbucket.com/names/icon.ly?source=ext) for modern, well-designed & cute icons which fit in perfectly with this design.\n\nFor the font, I decided to use [GT Welsheim](https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-walsheim) - which happens to be the same font on this website! It's a modern, readable, & fits the modern theme of this project (and this website) really well.\n","title":"Swiggy","description":"A modern, dark redesign of the Swiggy app","link":"https://www.behance.net/gallery/127606087/Swiggy-Redesign","graphic":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/785862408606187528/891731793038942208/Cover.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
