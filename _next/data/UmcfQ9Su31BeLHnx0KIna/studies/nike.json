{"pageProps":{"studyData":{"id":"nike","contentHtml":"\n# The Idea\n\nI was scrolling through my YouTube feed, where I found a new [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIjZSJB1uyc&t=1059s) by one of my favourite design channels, [Cuberto](https://www.youtube.com/c/CubertoDesign). It was on preparing design portfolios on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/harshhhdev), where it showed their step-by-step process of their [McDonald's Kiosk Redesign](https://www.behance.net/gallery/84835219/McDonalds-Kiosk-Redesign). I really enjoyed the video, and afterwards I decided I wanted to create something similar. Coincidentally, I was planning on buying new sneakers at the time, and I decided to pick the [Nike mobile app](https://www.nike.com/nike-app) to redesign.\n\n# Planning\n\nFirst, I downloaded the [Nike iOS app](https://www.nike.com/nike-app) on my iPhone, and played around with it a bit. The app was simple, & got the job done. But it felt lifeless and boring to interact with. The colours were bland, and my engagement was in general pretty low.\n\nI decided to make visuals the main aspects of the design. I wanted to create fresh & interesting visuals for users, with unique colours and fluid layouts, & remove the boring look of it.\n\n# User Interface\n\nThis application is targeted at a wide audience, ranging from people in their teens (like me) to 40 & 50 year olds. Due to it's relatively young audience, I decided I could ease accessibility rules a little in my design, & experiment around more with shadows, gradients, etc.\n\nI decided to create both a light & dim-ish dark mode, as many people (including me) don't like looking at bright things for long periods of time, especially at night.\n\nFor the font, I decided to go with [Averta](https://thedesignersfoundry.com/averta), by [T:D:F](https://thedesignersfoundry.com/). It closely resembles [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/), which is one the most readable fonts along with being of my favourites.  \n\nI really love [Averta](https://thedesignersfoundry.com/averta). It has a geometrical, simple yet appealing look which just blends in perfectly with (almost) anything. They characters are drawn to perfect sizes, and are coherent to read & look at.\n","title":"Nike","description":"The Nike mobile app redesigned with a new & fluid look","link":"https://www.behance.net/gallery/127241567/Nike-Mobile","graphic":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/785862408606187528/891731791092809758/Cover2.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
